# node-red-contrib-Ala-node

## Overview
This node is a node for forcibly converting all the alphabet character strings passed as input to the character string "Taipon rock".

Even if the input parameter passed is not a character string, "Ala-node" is forcibly returned.

In this process, it is a wonderful node that changed the sample node that was executing toLowerCase, which is an instance method of String object in JavaScript, to a process that just returns a meaningless constant.


## how to use
It is used when you want to forcibly convert all the character strings of the parameters to be passed to "Ala-node".
DON'T publish this kind of nodes, because it will be definitly spam node.
